# custom_agents.yaml — User-defined agents for Vibecraft
#
# Each entry is an agent definition.
# Fields:
#   name:     (required) agent identifier, used for .md filename
#   triggers: (optional) keywords — agent is included only if any
#             appear in research.md or stack.md (case-insensitive).
#             Omit triggers to always include the agent.
#   template: (optional) base template to use if no specific .md.j2 exists.
#             Defaults to base_agent. Currently unused by bootstrapper
#             but reserved for future per-agent template selection.
#
# Usage:
#   vibecraft init --research research.md --stack stack.md --agents custom_agents.yaml
